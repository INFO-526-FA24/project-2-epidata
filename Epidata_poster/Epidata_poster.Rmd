# Introduction

We use data visualizations to explore the similarities and differences among some significant pandemics from human history, including Cholera, Dengue, and COVID-19.

# Exploration

### Total cases and deaths over time

# Conclusions

-   Dengue occurred seasonally, mostly late spring to early summer. Cholera outbreaks are closely related to contamination of water sources. COVID-19 had higher mortality rate at the early stage and the total infected cases had spiked at the late stage.
-   The monthly number of news articles related to COVID-19 and the month total cases of infected COVID-19 are inversely correlated.
-   Among the three pandemics, COVID-19 has the longest illness duration; Cholera has the highest mortality rate; Dengue has the longeset incubation period.

# Future Directions

-   Emphasize on the time stamps of each huge outbreaks and research on the reasons behind them.
-   Research on other pandemics and compare the results.
