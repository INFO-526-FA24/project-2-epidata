## Did news reports have any impact on the disease growth rates?

-   Visualization: Use time series to see the disease growth rate and use scatter plot to understand the changes in disease growth rate before and after news reports. This step will only apply to those pandemics in modern days when there were recorded news media.

-   Reason: This comparison can reveal the role of media in public awareness and response, helping assess if early media coverage affected outbreak management.

Our objective was to use time series to see the disease growth rate and understand the changes in disease growth rate before and after news reports. From September 2020 onwards, the trend of the covid-19 outbreak could be characterized by a “second wave”, especially in the introduction of tougher bordering restrictions, and the surge in the number of cases. At the same time,  several media reports also reported that it was the beginning of the second wave of the pandemic. Therefore, we chose to filter news about covid-19 through September 2020 The news data was obtained from Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI). News was collected by Web Scraper.

The shaded gray rectangle is the number of news monthly news releases, while its axis corresponds to the right part of the y-axis. The red line represents the total number of covid-19 and corresponds to the left y-axis. From the graph we can see that when the number of news releases rises significantly, the growth in the total number of cases is slowing down, most notably from April to May 2020.The growth rate of the number of news releases in April 2020 is 123.81%, while the growth rate of the total number of cases is only 26.34%. Meanwhile, the number of cases increased extremely rapidly from June to July 2020, with a growth rate of 89.01%, and the growth rate of news releases from June to July was only 8.55%. This interesting phenomenon may also suggest that the number of news releases in the early stages of the pandfemic was able to affect the number of new cases of infection to some extent.
