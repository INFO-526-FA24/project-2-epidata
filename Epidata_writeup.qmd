## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to dive deeper into some significant pandemics from human history, including Cholera, Dengue, and COVID-19. We are aware, to some extent, of the fact that these pandemics caused great loss and profoundly impacted human society in numerous ways, but we have no deeper understanding of them. Therefore, we want to use data visualizations to visually present and explore the similarities and differences among these pandemics or diseases that happened on a large scale in different time periods.

## Background

-   Cholera is an infectious disease that is spread by eating food or drinking water contaminated by already infected people. This disease typically has outbreaks in regions with poor sanitation.

-   Dengue is a disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes that bite people infected with dengue virus. This disease is particularly rampant in tropical and subtropical regions.

-   COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The pandemics started in late 2019 and declared over in May 2023.

## Datasets

Three original datasets were used in this project: [Cholera](https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/page10cholera_data/), [Dengue](https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/dengue_global/), and [COVID-19](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data), all obtained from World Health Organization (WHO) website.

## Exploration

### Question 1: What are the number of total cases and death counts over time?

#### Introduction

We wanted to explore the trends of both total cases and death counts with time for all three pandemics, so we chose to use stream graphs to visualize the information, because stream graphs are useful and effective to visualize time series data of two different but related variables.

#### Approach

To process the data and get the information for this task, we aggregated each dataset grouping by time (by Year for Cholera dataset, and by Year-Month for both Dengue and COVID-19 datasets) and obtained the numbers of total cases and death counts for each time period. Then we used ggplot to plot the information, specifically using "geom_area".

For all three graphs, the upper parts display the number of death counts with color red, the lower parts display the number of total cases with color blue, and the horizontal axes are the timelines. The start and the end values of the horizontal axes are different for each graph, because the original datasets collected the records from different time periods. The Cholera dataset contains information from the year 2000 to year 2023; the Dengue dataset contains information from January 1, 2010 to September 1, 2024; the COVID-19 dataset contains information from January 4, 2020 to September 22, 2024.

Since the number of death counts are in small proportions to the number of total cases for all three datasets, the upper parts of the stream graphs are not as observable as the lower parts. Therefore, the annotation texts were added to the graphs, denoting the highest several death counts along with the corresponding time.

#### Analysis

The stream graphs produced in the project are displayed below. ![Cholera stream graph](writeup_plots/cholera_stream.png) ![Dengue stream graph](writeup_plots/dengue_stream.png) ![COVID-19 stream graph](writeup_plots/covid_stream.png)

From the graphs above, we can observe that,

-   For Cholera, the biggest outbreaks happened around the years 2017 and 2019. Before these two periods, 2011 was the first huge outbreak, which had 0.59 million total cases as well as having the highest death counts. The outbreaks of Cholera are highly related to the contamination of water sources, so the regions with poor sanitation during years with disastrous flooding are the main sites of Cholera infections.

-   For Dengue, the biggest outbreaks happened in 2024, from January to June. The peak was in March 2024, having 2.74 million total cases in the month, and also having the most death counts. Dengue could be seasonal, because it’s mostly late spring to early summer that had the pandemic waves. It is highly likely due to the propagation of Aedes mosquitoes, which are responsible for the spread of the dengue pandemics.

-   For COVID-19, December 2020 to August 2021 had horrendous amounts of deaths, and then gradually decreased to a lower level. It may be due to the prevalence of vaccine access and quarantine measures taken into effect around the world. The total cases, however, had spikes in January 2022 and December 2022. The reasons may include the end of quarantine for most regions.

### Question 2: How did each pandemic spread geographically?

#### Introduction

Understanding the geographical spread of pandemics is crucial for effective public health interventions and global disease prevention. Cholera, dengue, and COVID-19, while differing in transmission methods, provide valuable insights into how infectious diseases propagate across regions.Analyzing the spatial patterns of these diseases highlights the factors influencing their transmission and informs strategies for future outbreak containment.

#### Approach

We pre-processed data for COVID-19, cholera, and dengue by renaming columns, standardizing dates, and ensuring consistent data types across datasets.Then aggregated case counts yearly and cumulatively for each country to generate combined datasets for each disease. As we are plotting our visualization on a world map from "rnaturalearth" package we ensured that country names were standardized and match the geographic boundaries in the world map data.

All three datasets were merged into a single dataset, adding a column to identify the disease and its case counts. This combined dataset was joined with spatial data from Natural Earth to prepare for mapping. Using Shiny, we built an interactive UI that lets users select diseases and years, and a heatmap was created with ggplot2 to show-case distribution by region.

The heatmaps showcase the relative intensity of the outbreaks, with darker shades indicating higher concentrations of reported cases. This allows for a quick and intuitive understanding of how the diseases have spread and which regions have been most heavily impacted.

#### Analysis

We have calculated yearly and cummulative cases for each disease and visualized the geographical spread of the data across all years and explored how this spread changes when filtered by specific years, providing insights into the temporal and geographical variations.

![Heat Map of Cholera](writeup_plots/task2_1.jpeg)

The heatmap of the cholera pandemic (Image 1) reveals a widespread distribution, with several hotspots across the globe. The disease appears to have a stronger presence in parts of Africa, Asia, and South America, potentially reflecting differences in infrastructure, access to clean water, and public health interventions.

![Heat Map of Dengue](writeup_plots/task2_2.jpeg)

The dengue heatmap (Image 2) shows a more concentrated pattern, with South America and parts of Southeast Asia experiencing higher case counts. This aligns with the known geographic range of the Aedes mosquito, the primary reason for dengue transmission.

![Heat Map of COVID](writeup_plots/task2_3.jpeg)

The COVID-19 heatmap (the third image in this subsection) shows a true global pandemic, with intense outbreaks occurring across North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. The speckled distribution suggests the rapid and widespread transmission of the virus, highlighting the challenges of containing a highly contagious respiratory disease.

#### Temporal Trends

##### COVID-19 (2020-2024)

-   **Early 2020**: The **United States** and **China** were the first major countries to experience significant outbreaks with **the U.S.** becoming the global epicenter by the end of the year.
-   **2021**: Countries like **India** and **Brazil** faced severe surges.
-   **2022-2023**: After vaccination rollouts, most **European** and **North American** countries saw a decline in cases. However, **China** saw a sharp spike in late 2022,
-   **2024**: As COVID-19 cases generally decreased globally, countries like **China** and **Brazil** still had occasional surges

##### Dengue (2010-2024)

-   **2010-2014**: Countries like **Brazil** onsistently reported dengue outbreaks.
-   **2015-2019**: There was an upward trend in cases in **Sri Lanka**, **Philippines**, and **Brazil**, with **Sri Lanka** experiencing its worst outbreak in 2017.
-   **2020-2021**: The pandemic lockdowns caused a temporary decline in cases globally.
-   **2023-2024**: The number of dengue cases reached an all-time high in countries like the **Philippines**, where over **400,000** cases were reported in a single year, indicating a sharp increase.

##### Cholera (2000-2024)

-   **2000-2010**: **Haiti**, **Bangladesh**, and **India** experienced recurring cholera outbreaks,
-   **2011-2015**: During this period, **Yemen** saw the emergence of new outbreaks, especially in **2014**. The disease remained endemic in parts of **South Asia** and **Africa**.
-   **2016-2020**: The largest outbreak occurred in **Yemen** from 2016 to 2018.
-   **2021-2024**: **Haiti** saw a resurgence in **2022-2023**, marking a new peak after years of decline.

#### Discussion

The visualizations provide a valuable overview of how these pandemics have unfolded on a global scale. The differences in the spatial patterns observed can be attributed to factors such as the modes of disease transmission, the availability of preventive measures, and the effectiveness of public health interventions.

By analyzing these heatmaps, policymakers and public health officials can identify areas of high risk and prioritize resource allocation and targeted interventions. Additionally, the insights gained from this analysis can inform the development of early warning systems, the enhancement of disease surveillance, and the creation of more resilient healthcare systems.

### Question 3: Is there a correlation between the releases of news articles reporting COVID-19 and the spread speed of COVID-19?

### Question 4: What are the differences in the disease manifestation among three pandemics, specifically in incubation period, mortality rate, and illness duration?




## Conclusion
Different epidemics have different types of outbreaks. Dengue pandemics occurred seasonally, mostly late spring to early summer. This is likely due to the propogation of Aedes mosquitoes during these periods, which are responsible for the spread of the dengue pandemics. Cholera epidemics outbreaks are closely related to contamination of water sources, which is associated with years with heavy rainfall and flooding. COVID-19 had higher mortality rate at the early stage of pandemics than at the late stage, likely due to the vaccine access at the late stage; the total infected cases had spiked at the late stage, likely due to the end of quarantine measure.

The monthly number of news articles related to COVID-19 and the month total cases of infected COVID-19 are inversely correlated. It can be reasonably inferred that the news of COVID-19 helped raise people's awareness of the pandemics, reminding people to sanitize frequently and reducing social contacts, which then indirectly reduced the number of total cases.

Ultimately, this project demonstrates the power of data visualization in enhancing our understanding of global health challenges. By leveraging these insights, we can better prepare for and respond to future pandemics, ultimately improving the well-being of communities around the world.


## Future Directions
We can emphasize on the time stamps of each pandemics where there were huge outbreaks, and research on the reasons behind them.

We can also research on pandemics other than Cholera, Dengue and COVID-19, and compare the results to find the differences and similarities. Summarize the methods to try to provide suggestions on efficiently containing the spread of pandemics.
